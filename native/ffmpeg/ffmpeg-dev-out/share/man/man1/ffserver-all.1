.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
ffserver [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBffserver\fR is a streaming server for both audio and video.
It supports several live feeds, streaming from files and time shifting
on live feeds. You can seek to positions in the past on each live
feed, provided you specify a big enough feed storage.
.PP
\&\fBffserver\fR is configured through a configuration file, which
is read at startup. If not explicitly specified, it will read from
\&\fI/etc/ffserver.conf\fR.
.PP
\&\fBffserver\fR receives prerecorded files or \s-1FFM\s0 streams from some
\&\fBffmpeg\fR instance as input, then streams them over
\&\s-1RTP/RTSP/HTTP.\s0
.PP
An \fBffserver\fR instance will listen on some port as specified
in the configuration file. You can launch one or more instances of
\&\fBffmpeg\fR and send one or more \s-1FFM\s0 streams to the port where
ffserver is expecting to receive them. Alternately, you can make
\&\fBffserver\fR launch such \fBffmpeg\fR instances at startup.
.PP
Input streams are called feeds, and each one is specified by a
\&\f(CW\*(C`<Feed>\*(C'\fR section in the configuration file.
.PP
For each feed you can have different output streams in various
formats, each one specified by a \f(CW\*(C`<Stream>\*(C'\fR section in the
configuration file.
.SH "DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBffserver\fR works by forwarding streams encoded by
\&\fBffmpeg\fR, or pre-recorded streams which are read from disk.
.PP
Precisely, \fBffserver\fR acts as an \s-1HTTP\s0 server, accepting \s-1POST\s0
requests from \fBffmpeg\fR to acquire the stream to publish, and
serving \s-1RTSP\s0 clients or \s-1HTTP\s0 clients \s-1GET\s0 requests with the stream
media content.
.PP
A feed is an \fB\s-1FFM\s0\fR stream created by \fBffmpeg\fR, and sent to
a port where \fBffserver\fR is listening.
.PP
Each feed is identified by a unique name, corresponding to the name
of the resource published on \fBffserver\fR, and is configured by
a dedicated \f(CW\*(C`Feed\*(C'\fR section in the configuration file.
.PP
The feed publish \s-1URL\s0 is given by:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        http://<ffserver_ip_address>:<http_port>/<feed_name>
.Ve
.PP
where \fIffserver_ip_address\fR is the \s-1IP\s0 address of the machine where
\&\fBffserver\fR is installed, \fIhttp_port\fR is the port number of
the \s-1HTTP\s0 server (configured through the \fBHTTPPort\fR option), and
\&\fIfeed_name\fR is the name of the corresponding feed defined in the
configuration file.
.PP
Each feed is associated to a file which is stored on disk. This stored
file is used to send pre-recorded data to a player as fast as
possible when new content is added in real-time to the stream.
.PP
A \*(L"live-stream\*(R" or \*(L"stream\*(R" is a resource published by
\&\fBffserver\fR, and made accessible through the \s-1HTTP\s0 protocol to
clients.
.PP
A stream can be connected to a feed, or to a file. In the first case,
the published stream is forwarded from the corresponding feed
generated by a running instance of \fBffmpeg\fR, in the second
case the stream is read from a pre-recorded file.
.PP
Each stream is identified by a unique name, corresponding to the name
of the resource served by \fBffserver\fR, and is configured by
a dedicated \f(CW\*(C`Stream\*(C'\fR section in the configuration file.
.PP
The stream access \s-1HTTP URL\s0 is given by:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        http://<ffserver_ip_address>:<http_port>/<stream_name>[<options>]
.Ve
.PP
The stream access \s-1RTSP URL\s0 is given by:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        http://<ffserver_ip_address>:<rtsp_port>/<stream_name>[<options>]
.Ve
.PP
\&\fIstream_name\fR is the name of the corresponding stream defined in
the configuration file. \fIoptions\fR is a list of options specified
after the \s-1URL\s0 which affects how the stream is served by
\&\fBffserver\fR. \fIhttp_port\fR and \fIrtsp_port\fR are the \s-1HTTP\s0
and \s-1RTSP\s0 ports configured with the options \fIHTTPPort\fR and
\&\fIRTSPPort\fR respectively.
.PP
In case the stream is associated to a feed, the encoding parameters
must be configured in the stream configuration. They are sent to
\&\fBffmpeg\fR when setting up the encoding. This allows
\&\fBffserver\fR to define the encoding parameters used by
the \fBffmpeg\fR encoders.
.PP
The \fBffmpeg\fR \fBoverride_ffserver\fR commandline option
allows one to override the encoding parameters set by the server.
.PP
Multiple streams can be connected to the same feed.
.PP
For example, you can have a situation described by the following
graph:

.SS "\s-1FFM, FFM2\s0 formats"
.IX Subsection "FFM, FFM2 formats"
\&\s-1FFM\s0 and \s-1FFM2\s0 are formats used by ffserver. They allow storing a wide variety of
video and audio streams and encoding options, and can store a moving time segment
of an infinite movie or a whole movie.
.PP
\&\s-1FFM\s0 is version specific, and there is limited compatibility of \s-1FFM\s0 files
generated by one version of ffmpeg/ffserver and another version of
ffmpeg/ffserver. It may work but it is not guaranteed to work.
.PP
\&\s-1FFM2\s0 is extensible while maintaining compatibility and should work between
differing versions of tools. \s-1FFM2\s0 is the default.
.SS "Status stream"
.IX Subsection "Status stream"
\&\fBffserver\fR supports an \s-1HTTP\s0 interface which exposes the
current status of the server.
.PP
Simply point your browser to the address of the special status stream
specified in the configuration file.
.PP
For example if you have:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        <Stream status.html>
\&        Format status
\&        
\&        # Only allow local people to get the status
\&        ACL allow localhost
\&        ACL allow 192.168.0.0 192.168.255.255
\&        </Stream>
.Ve
.PP
then the server will post a page with the status information when
the special stream \fIstatus.html\fR is requested.
.SS "How do I make it work?"
.IX Subsection "How do I make it work?"
As a simple test, just run the following two command lines where \s-1INPUTFILE\s0
is some file which you can decode with ffmpeg:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        ffserver \-f doc/ffserver.conf &
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUTFILE http://localhost:8090/feed1.ffm
.Ve
.PP
At this point you should be able to go to your Windows machine and fire up
Windows Media Player (\s-1WMP\s0). Go to Open \s-1URL\s0 and enter
.PP
.Vb 1
\&            http://<linuxbox>:8090/test.asf
.Ve
.PP
You should (after a short delay) see video and hear audio.
.PP
\&\s-1WARNING:\s0 trying to stream test1.mpg doesn't work with \s-1WMP\s0 as it tries to
transfer the entire file before starting to play.
The same is true of \s-1AVI\s0 files.
.PP
You should edit the \fIffserver.conf\fR file to suit your needs (in
terms of frame rates etc). Then install \fBffserver\fR and
\&\fBffmpeg\fR, write a script to start them up, and off you go.
.SS "What else can it do?"
.IX Subsection "What else can it do?"
You can replay video from .ffm files that was recorded earlier.
However, there are a number of caveats, including the fact that the
ffserver parameters must match the original parameters used to record the
file. If they do not, then ffserver deletes the file before recording into it.
(Now that I write this, it seems broken).
.PP
You can fiddle with many of the codec choices and encoding parameters, and
there are a bunch more parameters that you cannot control. Post a message
to the mailing list if there are some 'must have' parameters. Look in
ffserver.conf for a list of the currently available controls.
.PP
It will automatically generate the \s-1ASX\s0 or \s-1RAM\s0 files that are often used
in browsers. These files are actually redirections to the underlying \s-1ASF\s0
or \s-1RM\s0 file. The reason for this is that the browser often fetches the
entire file before starting up the external viewer. The redirection files
are very small and can be transferred quickly. [The stream itself is
often 'infinite' and thus the browser tries to download it and never
finishes.]
.SS "Tips"
.IX Subsection "Tips"
* When you connect to a live stream, most players (\s-1WMP, RA,\s0 etc) want to
buffer a certain number of seconds of material so that they can display the
signal continuously. However, ffserver (by default) starts sending data
in realtime. This means that there is a pause of a few seconds while the
buffering is being done by the player. The good news is that this can be
cured by adding a '?buffer=5' to the end of the \s-1URL.\s0 This means that the
stream should start 5 seconds in the past \*(-- and so the first 5 seconds
of the stream are sent as fast as the network will allow. It will then
slow down to real time. This noticeably improves the startup experience.
.PP
You can also add a 'Preroll 15' statement into the ffserver.conf that will
add the 15 second prebuffering on all requests that do not otherwise
specify a time. In addition, ffserver will skip frames until a key_frame
is found. This further reduces the startup delay by not transferring data
that will be discarded.
.SS "Why does the ?buffer / Preroll stop working after a time?"
.IX Subsection "Why does the ?buffer / Preroll stop working after a time?"
It turns out that (on my machine at least) the number of frames successfully
grabbed is marginally less than the number that ought to be grabbed. This
means that the timestamp in the encoded data stream gets behind realtime.
This means that if you say 'Preroll 10', then when the stream gets 10
or more seconds behind, there is no Preroll left.
.PP
Fixing this requires a change in the internals of how timestamps are
handled.
.ie n .SS "Does the ""?date="" stuff work."
.el .SS "Does the \f(CW?date=\fP stuff work."
.IX Subsection "Does the ?date= stuff work."
Yes (subject to the limitation outlined above). Also note that whenever you
start ffserver, it deletes the ffm file (if any parameters have changed),
thus wiping out what you had recorded before.
.PP
The format of the \f(CW\*(C`?date=xxxxxx\*(C'\fR is fairly flexible. You should use one
of the following formats (the 'T' is literal):
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        * YYYY\-MM\-DDTHH:MM:SS     (localtime)
\&        * YYYY\-MM\-DDTHH:MM:SSZ    (UTC)
.Ve
.PP
You can omit the YYYY-MM-DD, and then it refers to the current day. However
note that \fB?date=16:00:00\fR refers to 16:00 on the current day \*(-- this
may be in the future and so is unlikely to be useful.
.PP
You use this by adding the ?date= to the end of the \s-1URL\s0 for the stream.
For example:   \fBhttp://localhost:8080/test.asf?date=2002\-07\-26T23:05:00\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a string
representing a number as input, which may be followed by one of the \s-1SI\s0
unit prefixes, for example: 'K', 'M', or 'G'.
.PP
If 'i' is appended to the \s-1SI\s0 unit prefix, the complete prefix will be
interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiples, which are based on
powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending 'B' to the \s-1SI\s0 unit
prefix multiplies the value by 8. This allows using, for example:
\&'\s-1KB\s0', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as number suffixes.
.PP
Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing
the option name with \*(L"no\*(R". For example using \*(L"\-nofoo\*(R"
will set the boolean option with name \*(L"foo\*(R" to false.
.SS "Stream specifiers"
.IX Subsection "Stream specifiers"
Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream specifiers
are used to precisely specify which stream(s) a given option belongs to.
.PP
A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and
separated from it by a colon. E.g. \f(CW\*(C`\-codec:a:1 ac3\*(C'\fR contains the
\&\f(CW\*(C`a:1\*(C'\fR stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream. Therefore, it
would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.
.PP
A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is applied to all
of them. E.g. the stream specifier in \f(CW\*(C`\-b:a 128k\*(C'\fR matches all audio
streams.
.PP
An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, \f(CW\*(C`\-codec copy\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`\-codec: copy\*(C'\fR would copy all the streams without reencoding.
.PP
Possible forms of stream specifiers are:
.IP "\fIstream_index\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream_index"
Matches the stream with this index. E.g. \f(CW\*(C`\-threads:1 4\*(C'\fR would set the
thread count for the second stream to 4.
.IP "\fIstream_type\fR\fB[:\fR\fIstream_index\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream_type[:stream_index]"
\&\fIstream_type\fR is one of following: 'v' or 'V' for video, 'a' for audio, 's'
for subtitle, 'd' for data, and 't' for attachments. 'v' matches all video
streams, 'V' only matches video streams which are not attached pictures, video
thumbnails or cover arts.  If \fIstream_index\fR is given, then it matches
stream number \fIstream_index\fR of this type. Otherwise, it matches all
streams of this type.
.IP "\fBp:\fR\fIprogram_id\fR\fB[:\fR\fIstream_index\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "p:program_id[:stream_index]"
If \fIstream_index\fR is given, then it matches the stream with number \fIstream_index\fR
in the program with the id \fIprogram_id\fR. Otherwise, it matches all streams in the
program.
.IP "\fB#\fR\fIstream_id\fR \fBor i:\fR\fIstream_id\fR" 4
.IX Item "#stream_id or i:stream_id"
Match the stream by stream id (e.g. \s-1PID\s0 in MPEG-TS container).
.IP "\fBm:\fR\fIkey\fR\fB[:\fR\fIvalue\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "m:key[:value]"
Matches streams with the metadata tag \fIkey\fR having the specified value. If
\&\fIvalue\fR is not given, matches streams that contain the given tag with any
value.
.IP "\fBu\fR" 4
.IX Item "u"
Matches streams with usable configuration, the codec must be defined and the
essential information such as video dimension or audio sample rate must be present.
.Sp
Note that in \fBffmpeg\fR, matching by metadata will only work properly for
input files.
.SS "Generic options"
.IX Subsection "Generic options"
These options are shared amongst the ff* tools.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L"
Show license.
.IP "\fB\-h, \-?, \-help, \-\-help [\fR\fIarg\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, -?, -help, --help [arg]"

This option is used to benchmark all available OpenCL devices and print the
results. This option is only available when FFmpeg has been compiled with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-opencl\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
When FFmpeg is configured with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-opencl\*(C'\fR, the options for the
global OpenCL context are set via \fB\-opencl_options\fR. See the
\&\*(L"OpenCL Options\*(R" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual for the complete list of
supported options. Amongst others, these options include the ability to select
a specific platform and device to run the OpenCL code on. By default, FFmpeg
will run on the first device of the first platform. While the options for the
global OpenCL context provide flexibility to the user in selecting the OpenCL
device of their choice, most users would probably want to select the fastest
OpenCL device for their system.
.Sp
This option assists the selection of the most efficient configuration by
identifying the appropriate device for the user's system. The built-in
benchmark is run on all the OpenCL devices and the performance is measured for
each device. The devices in the results list are sorted based on their
performance with the fastest device listed first. The user can subsequently
invoke \fBffmpeg\fR using the device deemed most appropriate via
\&\fB\-opencl_options\fR to obtain the best performance for the OpenCL
accelerated code.
.Sp
Typical usage to use the fastest OpenCL device involve the following steps.
.Sp
Run the command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-opencl_bench
.Ve
.Sp
Note down the platform \s-1ID \s0(\fIpidx\fR) and device \s-1ID \s0(\fIdidx\fR) of the first

are listed under AVFormatContext options for containers/devices and under
AVCodecContext options for codecs.
.IP "\fBprivate\fR" 4
.IX Item "private"
These options are specific to the given container, device or codec. Private
options are listed under their corresponding containers/devices/codecs.
.PP
For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to
an \s-1MP3\s0 file, use the \fBid3v2_version\fR private option of the \s-1MP3\s0
muxer:
.PP
.Vb 1

.PP
All codec AVOptions are per-stream, and thus a stream specifier

Note: the \fB\-nooption\fR syntax cannot be used for boolean
AVOptions, use \fB\-option 0\fR/\fB\-option 1\fR.

encoding options. Not all encoding options are supported, in
particular it is not possible to set encoder private options. In order
to override the encoding options specified by \fBffserver\fR, you
can use the \fBffmpeg\fR \fBoverride_ffserver\fR commandline
option.
.PP
Only one of the \fBFeed\fR and \fBFile\fR options should be set.

.SH "SYNTAX"
.IX Header "SYNTAX"
This section documents the syntax and formats employed by the FFmpeg
libraries and tools.
.SS "Quoting and escaping"
.IX Subsection "Quoting and escaping"
FFmpeg adopts the following quoting and escaping mechanism, unless
explicitly specified. The following rules are applied:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fB'\fR and \fB\e\fR are special characters (respectively used for
quoting and escaping). In addition to them, there might be other
special characters depending on the specific syntax where the escaping
and quoting are employed.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A special character is escaped by prefixing it with a \fB\e\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
All characters enclosed between \fB''\fR are included literally in the
parsed string. The quote character \fB'\fR itself cannot be quoted,
so you may need to close the quote and escape it.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Leading and trailing whitespaces, unless escaped or quoted, are
removed from the parsed string.
.PP
Note that you may need to add a second level of escaping when using
the command line or a script, which depends on the syntax of the
adopted shell language.
.PP
The function \f(CW\*(C`av_get_token\*(C'\fR defined in
\&\fIlibavutil/avstring.h\fR can be used to parse a token quoted or
escaped according to the rules defined above.
.PP
The tool \fItools/ffescape\fR in the FFmpeg source tree can be used
to automatically quote or escape a string in a script.
.PP
\fIExamples\fR
.IX Subsection "Examples"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Escape the string \f(CW\*(C`Crime d\*(AqAmour\*(C'\fR containing the \f(CW\*(C`\*(Aq\*(C'\fR special
character:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        Crime d\e\*(AqAmour
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
The string above contains a quote, so the \f(CW\*(C`\*(Aq\*(C'\fR needs to be escaped
when quoting it:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \*(AqCrime d\*(Aq\e\*(Aq\*(AqAmour\*(Aq
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Include leading or trailing whitespaces using quoting:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \*(Aq  this string starts and ends with whitespaces  \*(Aq
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Escaping and quoting can be mixed together:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \*(Aq The string \*(Aq\e\*(Aqstring\e\*(Aq\*(Aq is a string \*(Aq
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
To include a literal \fB\e\fR you can use either escaping or quoting:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \*(Aqc:\efoo\*(Aq can be written as c:\e\efoo
.Ve
.SS "Date"
.IX Subsection "Date"
The accepted syntax is:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        [(YYYY\-MM\-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH:MM:SS[.m...]]])|(HHMMSS[.m...]]]))[Z]
\&        now
.Ve
.PP
If the value is \*(L"now\*(R" it takes the current time.
.PP
Time is local time unless Z is appended, in which case it is
interpreted as \s-1UTC.\s0
If the year-month-day part is not specified it takes the current
year-month-day.
.SS "Time duration"
.IX Subsection "Time duration"
There are two accepted syntaxes for expressing time duration.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        [\-][<HH>:]<MM>:<SS>[.<m>...]
.Ve
.PP
\&\fI\s-1HH\s0\fR expresses the number of hours, \fI\s-1MM\s0\fR the number of minutes
for a maximum of 2 digits, and \fI\s-1SS\s0\fR the number of seconds for a
maximum of 2 digits. The \fIm\fR at the end expresses decimal value for
\&\fI\s-1SS\s0\fR.
.PP
\&\fIor\fR
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        [\-]<S>+[.<m>...]
.Ve
.PP
\&\fIS\fR expresses the number of seconds, with the optional decimal part
\&\fIm\fR.
.PP
In both expressions, the optional \fB\-\fR indicates negative duration.

.SS "Ratio"
.IX Subsection "Ratio"
A ratio can be expressed as an expression, or in the form
\&\fInumerator\fR:\fIdenominator\fR.
.PP
Note that a ratio with infinite (1/0) or negative value is
considered valid, so you should check on the returned value if you
want to exclude those values.
.PP
The undefined value can be expressed using the \*(L"0:0\*(R" string.
.SS "Color"
.IX Subsection "Color"
It can be the name of a color as defined below (case insensitive match) or a
\&\f(CW\*(C`[0x|#]RRGGBB[AA]\*(C'\fR sequence, possibly followed by @ and a string
representing the alpha component.
.PP
The alpha component may be a string composed by \*(L"0x\*(R" followed by an
hexadecimal number or a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, which
represents the opacity value (\fB0x00\fR or \fB0.0\fR means completely
transparent, \fB0xff\fR or \fB1.0\fR completely opaque). If the alpha
component is not specified then \fB0xff\fR is assumed.
.PP
The string \fBrandom\fR will result in a random color.

A custom channel layout can be specified as a sequence of terms, separated by
\&'+' or '|'. Each term can be:
.IP "\(bu" 4
the name of a standard channel layout (e.g. \fBmono\fR,
\&\fBstereo\fR, \fB4.0\fR, \fBquad\fR, \fB5.0\fR, etc.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
the name of a single channel (e.g. \fB\s-1FL\s0\fR, \fB\s-1FR\s0\fR, \fB\s-1FC\s0\fR, \fB\s-1LFE\s0\fR, etc.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
a number of channels, in decimal, followed by 'c', yielding the default channel
layout for that number of channels (see the function
\&\f(CW\*(C`av_get_default_channel_layout\*(C'\fR). Note that not all channel counts have a
default layout.
.IP "\(bu" 4
a number of channels, in decimal, followed by 'C', yielding an unknown channel
layout with the specified number of channels. Note that not all channel layout
specification strings support unknown channel layouts.
.IP "\(bu" 4
a channel layout mask, in hexadecimal starting with \*(L"0x\*(R" (see the

Before libavutil version 53 the trailing character \*(L"c\*(R" to specify a number of

.SH "EXPRESSION EVALUATION"
.IX Header "EXPRESSION EVALUATION"
When evaluating an arithmetic expression, FFmpeg uses an internal
formula evaluator, implemented through the \fIlibavutil/eval.h\fR
interface.
.PP
An expression may contain unary, binary operators, constants, and
functions.
.PP
Two expressions \fIexpr1\fR and \fIexpr2\fR can be combined to form
another expression "\fIexpr1\fR;\fIexpr2\fR".
\&\fIexpr1\fR and \fIexpr2\fR are evaluated in turn, and the new
expression evaluates to the value of \fIexpr2\fR.
.PP
The following binary operators are available: \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The following unary operators are available: \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR.
.PP

Find an input value for which the function represented by \fIexpr\fR
with argument \fI\fIld\fI\|(0)\fR is 0 in the interval 0..\fImax\fR.
.Sp
The expression in \fIexpr\fR must denote a continuous function or the
result is undefined.
.Sp
\&\fI\fIld\fI\|(0)\fR is used to represent the function input value, which means
that the given expression will be evaluated multiple times with
various input values that the expression can access through

Return the current (wallclock) time in seconds.
.IP "\fBtrunc(expr)\fR" 4
.IX Item "trunc(expr)"
Round the value of expression \fIexpr\fR towards zero to the nearest

.IP "\fBwhile(cond, expr)\fR" 4
.IX Item "while(cond, expr)"
Evaluate expression \fIexpr\fR while the expression \fIcond\fR is
non-zero, and returns the value of the last \fIexpr\fR evaluation, or
\&\s-1NAN\s0 if \fIcond\fR was always false.
.PP
The following constants are available:
.IP "\fB\s-1PI\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "PI"
area of the unit disc, approximately 3.14
.IP "\fBE\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\s-1PHI\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "PHI"
golden ratio (1+\fIsqrt\fR\|(5))/2, approximately 1.618
.PP
Assuming that an expression is considered \*(L"true\*(R" if it has a non-zero
value, note that:
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR works like \s-1AND\s0
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR works like \s-1OR\s0
.PP
For example the construct:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        if (A AND B) then C
.Ve
.PP
is equivalent to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        if(A*B, C)
.Ve
.PP
In your C code, you can extend the list of unary and binary functions,
and define recognized constants, so that they are available for your
expressions.
.PP
The evaluator also recognizes the International System unit prefixes.
If 'i' is appended after the prefix, binary prefixes are used, which
are based on powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000.
The 'B' postfix multiplies the value by 8, and can be appended after a
unit prefix or used alone. This allows using for example '\s-1KB\s0', 'MiB',
\&'G' and 'B' as number postfix.
.PP
The list of available International System prefixes follows, with
indication of the corresponding powers of 10 and of 2.

Enables the use of the long term prediction extension which increases coding
efficiency in very low bandwidth situations such as encoding of voice or
solo piano music by extending constant harmonic peaks in bands throughout

Enables the use of a more traditional style of prediction where the spectral
coefficients transmitted are replaced by the difference of the current

in practice this can improve quality for low to mid bitrate audio.

These encoders implement part of \s-1ATSC A/52:2010\s0 and \s-1ETSI TS 102 366,\s0 as well as
the undocumented RealAudio 3 (a.k.a. dnet).
.PP
The \fIac3\fR encoder uses floating-point math, while the \fIac3_fixed\fR
encoder only uses fixed-point integer math. This does not mean that one is
always faster, just that one or the other may be better suited to a
particular system. The floating-point encoder will generally produce better
quality audio for a given bitrate. The \fIac3_fixed\fR encoder is not the
default codec for any of the output formats, so it must be specified explicitly
using the option \f(CW\*(C`\-acodec ac3_fixed\*(C'\fR in order to use it.

The \s-1AC\-3\s0 metadata options are used to set parameters that describe the audio,
but in most cases do not affect the audio encoding itself. Some of the options
do directly affect or influence the decoding and playback of the resulting
bitstream, while others are just for informational purposes. A few of the
options will add bits to the output stream that could otherwise be used for
audio data, and will thus affect the quality of the output. Those will be
indicated accordingly with a note in the option list below.

The libfdk-aac library is based on the Fraunhofer \s-1FDK AAC\s0 code from
the Android project.
.PP
Requires the presence of the libfdk-aac headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-libfdk\-aac\*(C'\fR. The library is also incompatible with \s-1GPL,\s0

libwebp WebP Image encoder wrapper
.PP
libwebp is Google's official encoder for WebP images. It can encode in either
lossy or lossless mode. Lossy images are essentially a wrapper around a \s-1VP8\s0
frame. Lossless images are a separate codec developed by Google.
.PP
\fIPixel Format\fR
.IX Subsection "Pixel Format"
.PP
Currently, libwebp only supports \s-1YUV420\s0 for lossy and \s-1RGB\s0 for lossless due
to limitations of the format and libwebp. Alpha is supported for either mode.
Because of \s-1API\s0 limitations, if \s-1RGB\s0 is passed in when encoding lossy or \s-1YUV\s0 is
passed in for encoding lossless, the pixel format will automatically be
converted using functions from libwebp. This is not ideal and is done only for
convenience.

.IP "\fB\-compression_level\fR \fIinteger\fR" 4
.IX Item "-compression_level integer"
For lossy, this is a quality/speed tradeoff. Higher values give better quality
for a given size at the cost of increased encoding time. For lossless, this is
a size/speed tradeoff. Higher values give smaller size at the cost of increased
encoding time. More specifically, it controls the number of extra algorithms
and compression tools used, and varies the combination of these tools. This
maps to the \fImethod\fR option in libwebp. The valid range is 0 to 6.
Default is 4.
.IP "\fB\-qscale\fR \fIfloat\fR" 4

For lossy encoding, this controls image quality, 0 to 100. For lossless

build. In other words, it is not possible to build one FFmpeg with multiple
versions of x264 with different bit depths.

In the default mode of operation the encoder has to honor frame constraints
(i.e. not produce frames with size bigger than requested) while still making
output picture as good as possible.
A frame containing a lot of small details is harder to compress and the encoder
would spend more time searching for appropriate quantizers for each slice.

Unpack DivX-style packed B\-frames.
.PP
DivX-style packed B\-frames are not valid \s-1MPEG\-4\s0 and were only a
workaround for the broken Video for Windows subsystem.
They use more space, can cause minor \s-1AV\s0 sync issues, require more
\&\s-1CPU\s0 power to decode (unless the player has some decoded picture queue
to compensate the 2,0,2,0 frame per packet style) and cause
trouble if copied into a standard container like mp4 or mpeg\-ps/ts,
because \s-1MPEG\-4\s0 decoders may not be able to decode them, since they are
not valid \s-1MPEG\-4.\s0
.PP
For example to fix an \s-1AVI\s0 file containing an \s-1MPEG\-4\s0 stream with
DivX-style packed B\-frames using \fBffmpeg\fR, you can use the command:

This demuxer presents all AVStreams from all variant streams.
The id field is set to the bitrate variant index number. By setting
the discard flags on AVStreams (by pressing 'a' or 'v' in ffplay),
the caller can decide which variant streams to actually receive.
The total bitrate of the variant that the stream belongs to is

This demuxer is used to demux \s-1APNG\s0 files.
All headers, but the \s-1PNG\s0 signature, up to (but not including) the first

.SS "concat"
.IX Subsection "concat"
Virtual concatenation script demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer reads a list of files and other directives from a text file and
demuxes them one after the other, as if all their packets had been muxed
together.
.PP
The timestamps in the files are adjusted so that the first file starts at 0
and each next file starts where the previous one finishes. Note that it is
done globally and may cause gaps if all streams do not have exactly the same
length.
.PP
All files must have the same streams (same codecs, same time base, etc.).
.PP
The duration of each file is used to adjust the timestamps of the next file:
if the duration is incorrect (because it was computed using the bit-rate or
because the file is truncated, for example), it can cause artifacts. The
\&\f(CW\*(C`duration\*(C'\fR directive can be used to override the duration stored in
each file.
.PP
\fISyntax\fR
.IX Subsection "Syntax"
.PP
The script is a text file in extended-ASCII, with one directive per line.
Empty lines, leading spaces and lines starting with '#' are ignored. The

.el .IP "\fB\f(CBfile \f(CBpath\f(CB\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "file path"
Path to a file to read; special characters and spaces must be escaped with
backslash or single quotes.

.el .IP "\fB\f(CBffconcat version 1.0\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "ffconcat version 1.0"
Identify the script type and version. It also sets the \fBsafe\fR option
to 1 if it was \-1.
.Sp
To make FFmpeg recognize the format automatically, this directive must
appear exactly as is (no extra space or byte-order-mark) on the very first
line of the script.
.ie n .IP "\fB\fB""duration \f(BIdur\f(CB""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBduration \f(CBdur\f(CB\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "duration dur"
Duration of the file. This information can be specified from the file;
specifying it here may be more efficient or help if the information from the
file is not available or accurate.
.Sp
If the duration is set for all files, then it is possible to seek in the
whole concatenated video.
.ie n .IP "\fB\fB""inpoint \f(BItimestamp\f(CB""\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\f(CBinpoint \f(CBtimestamp\f(CB\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "inpoint timestamp"
In point of the file. When the demuxer opens the file it instantly seeks to the
specified timestamp. Seeking is done so that all streams can be presented
successfully at In point.
.Sp
This directive works best with intra frame codecs, because for non-intra frame
ones you will usually get extra packets before the actual In point and the
decoded content will most likely contain frames before In point too.
.Sp
For each file, packets before the file In point will have timestamps less than
the calculated start timestamp of the file (negative in case of the first
file), and the duration of the files (if not specified by the \f(CW\*(C`duration\*(C'\fR
directive) will be reduced based on their specified In point.
.Sp
Because of potential packets before the specified In point, packet timestamps
may overlap between two concatenated files.

.el .IP "\fB\f(CBoutpoint \f(CBtimestamp\f(CB\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "outpoint timestamp"
Out point of the file. When the demuxer reaches the specified decoding
timestamp in any of the streams, it handles it as an end of file condition and
skips the current and all the remaining packets from all streams.
.Sp
Out point is exclusive, which means that the demuxer will not output packets
with a decoding timestamp greater or equal to Out point.
.Sp
This directive works best with intra frame codecs and formats where all streams
are tightly interleaved. For non-intra frame codecs you will usually get
additional packets with presentation timestamp after Out point therefore the
decoded content will most likely contain frames after Out point too. If your
streams are not tightly interleaved you may not get all the packets from all
streams before Out point and you may only will be able to decode the earliest
stream until Out point.
.Sp
The duration of the files (if not specified by the \f(CW\*(C`duration\*(C'\fR
directive) will be reduced based on their specified Out point.

.el .IP "\fB\f(CBstream\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream"
Introduce a stream in the virtual file.
All subsequent stream-related directives apply to the last introduced

Some streams properties must be set in order to allow identifying the

If no streams are defined in the script, the streams from the first file are
copied.

.Sp
\&\fIpattern_type\fR accepts one of the following values.
.RS 4
.IP "\fBnone\fR" 4
.IX Item "none"
Disable pattern matching, therefore the video will only contain the specified
image. You should use this option if you do not want to create sequences from
multiple images and your filenames may contain special pattern characters.
.IP "\fBsequence\fR" 4
.IX Item "sequence"
Select a sequence pattern type, used to specify a sequence of files
indexed by sequential numbers.
.Sp
A sequence pattern may contain the string \*(L"%d\*(R" or "%0\fIN\fRd\*(L", which
specifies the position of the characters representing a sequential
number in each filename matched by the pattern. If the form
\&\*(R"%d0\fIN\fRd" is used, the string representing the number in each
filename is 0\-padded and \fIN\fR is the total number of 0\-padded
digits representing the number. The literal character '%' can be
specified in the pattern with the string \*(L"%%\*(R".
.Sp
If the sequence pattern contains \*(L"%d\*(R" or "%0\fIN\fRd", the first filename of
the file list specified by the pattern must contain a number
inclusively contained between \fIstart_number\fR and
\&\fIstart_number\fR+\fIstart_number_range\fR\-1, and all the following
numbers must be sequential.
.Sp
For example the pattern \*(L"img\-%03d.bmp\*(R" will match a sequence of
filenames of the form \fIimg\-001.bmp\fR, \fIimg\-002.bmp\fR, ...,
\&\fIimg\-010.bmp\fR, etc.; the pattern \*(L"i%%m%%g\-%d.jpg\*(R" will match a
sequence of filenames of the form \fIi%m%g\-1.jpg\fR,
\&\fIi%m%g\-2.jpg\fR, ..., \fIi%m%g\-10.jpg\fR, etc.
.Sp
Note that the pattern must not necessarily contain \*(L"%d\*(R" or
"%0\fIN\fRd", for example to convert a single image file
\&\fIimg.jpeg\fR you can employ the command:
.Sp
.Vb 1

.IP "\fBglob_sequence\fR \fI(deprecated, will be removed)\fR" 4
.IX Item "glob_sequence (deprecated, will be removed)"
Select a mixed glob wildcard/sequence pattern.
.Sp
If your version of libavformat was compiled with globbing support, and
the provided pattern contains at least one glob meta character among
\&\f(CW\*(C`%*?[]{}\*(C'\fR that is preceded by an unescaped \*(L"%\*(R", the pattern is
interpreted like a \f(CW\*(C`glob()\*(C'\fR pattern, otherwise it is interpreted
like a sequence pattern.
.Sp
All glob special characters \f(CW\*(C`%*?[]{}\*(C'\fR must be prefixed
with \*(L"%\*(R". To escape a literal \*(L"%\*(R" you shall use \*(L"%%\*(R".
.Sp
For example the pattern \f(CW\*(C`foo\-%*.jpeg\*(C'\fR will match all the
filenames prefixed by \*(L"foo\-\*(R" and terminating with \*(L".jpeg\*(R", and
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo\-%?%?%?.jpeg\*(C'\fR will match all the filenames prefixed with
\&\*(L"foo\-\*(R", followed by a sequence of three characters, and terminating

.PP
A \s-1SBG\s0 script can mix absolute and relative timestamps. If the script uses
either only absolute timestamps (including the script start time) or only
relative ones, then its layout is fixed, and the conversion is
straightforward. On the other hand, if the script mixes both kind of
timestamps, then the \fI\s-1NOW\s0\fR reference for relative timestamps will be
taken from the current time of day at the time the script is read, and the
script layout will be frozen according to that reference. That means that if
the script is directly played, the actual times will match the absolute
timestamps up to the sound controller's clock accuracy, but if the user
somehow pauses the playback or seeks, all times will be shifted accordingly.

Reserve the specified amount of bytes for the OpenDML master index of each

.SS "framecrc"
.IX Subsection "framecrc"
Per-packet \s-1CRC \s0(Cyclic Redundancy Check) testing format.
.PP
This muxer computes and prints the Adler\-32 \s-1CRC\s0 for each audio
and video packet. By default audio frames are converted to signed
16\-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the
\&\s-1CRC.\s0
.PP
The output of the muxer consists of a line for each audio and video
packet of the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        <stream_index>, <packet_dts>, <packet_pts>, <packet_duration>, <packet_size>, 0x<CRC>
.Ve
.PP
\&\fI\s-1CRC\s0\fR is a hexadecimal number 0\-padded to 8 digits containing the
\&\s-1CRC\s0 of the packet.
.PP
\fIExamples\fR
.IX Subsection "Examples"
.PP
For example to compute the \s-1CRC\s0 of the audio and video frames in
\&\fI\s-1INPUT\s0\fR, converted to raw audio and video packets, and store it
in the file \fIout.crc\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1

.PP
To print the information to stdout, use the command:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
With \fBffmpeg\fR, you can select the output format to which the
audio and video frames are encoded before computing the \s-1CRC\s0 for each
packet by specifying the audio and video codec. For example, to
compute the \s-1CRC\s0 of each decoded input audio frame converted to \s-1PCM\s0
unsigned 8\-bit and of each decoded input video frame converted to
\&\s-1MPEG\-2\s0 video, use the command:
.PP

.Ve
.PP
See also the \fBcrc\fR muxer.
.SS "framehash"
.IX Subsection "framehash"
Per-packet hash testing format.
.PP
This muxer computes and prints a cryptographic hash for each audio
and video packet. This can be used for packet-by-packet equality
checks without having to individually do a binary comparison on each.
.PP
By default audio frames are converted to signed 16\-bit raw audio and
video frames to raw video before computing the hash, but the output
of explicit conversions to other codecs can also be used. It uses the
\&\s-1SHA\-256\s0 cryptographic hash function by default, but supports several
other algorithms.
.PP
The output of the muxer consists of a line for each audio and video
packet of the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        <stream_index>, <packet_dts>, <packet_pts>, <packet_duration>, <packet_size>, <hash>

.SS "gif"
.IX Subsection "gif"
Animated \s-1GIF\s0 muxer.
.PP
It accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBloop\fR" 4
.IX Item "loop"
Set the number of times to loop the output. Use \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR for no loop, \f(CW0\fR
for looping indefinitely (default).
.IP "\fBfinal_delay\fR" 4
.IX Item "final_delay"
Force the delay (expressed in centiseconds) after the last frame. Each frame
ends with a delay until the next frame. The default is \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR, which is a
special value to tell the muxer to re-use the previous delay. In case of a
loop, you might want to customize this value to mark a pause for instance.
.PP
For example, to encode a gif looping 10 times, with a 5 seconds delay between
the loops:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUT \-loop 10 \-final_delay 500 out.gif
.Ve
.PP
Note 1: if you wish to extract the frames into separate \s-1GIF\s0 files, you need to
force the \fBimage2\fR muxer:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUT \-c:v gif \-f image2 "out%d.gif"
.Ve
.PP
Note 2: the \s-1GIF\s0 format has a very large time base: the delay between two frames
can therefore not be smaller than one centi second.
.SS "hash"
.IX Subsection "hash"
Hash testing format.
.PP
This muxer computes and prints a cryptographic hash of all the input
audio and video frames. This can be used for equality checks without
having to do a complete binary comparison.
.PP
By default audio frames are converted to signed 16\-bit raw audio and
video frames to raw video before computing the hash, but the output
of explicit conversions to other codecs can also be used. Timestamps
are ignored. It uses the \s-1SHA\-256\s0 cryptographic hash function by default,
but supports several other algorithms.
.PP
The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form:
\&\fIalgo\fR=\fIhash\fR, where \fIalgo\fR is a short string representing
the hash function used, and \fIhash\fR is a hexadecimal number
representing the computed hash.
.IP "\fBhash\fR \fIalgorithm\fR" 4
.IX Item "hash algorithm"

Apple \s-1HTTP\s0 Live Streaming muxer that segments MPEG-TS according to
the \s-1HTTP\s0 Live Streaming (\s-1HLS\s0) specification.
.PP
It creates a playlist file, and one or more segment files. The output filename
specifies the playlist filename.
.PP
By default, the muxer creates a file for each segment produced. These files
have the same name as the playlist, followed by a sequential number and a

For example, to convert an input file with \fBffmpeg\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1

which can be cyclic, for example if the \fBwrap\fR option is
specified.
.IP "\fBhls_segment_filename\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "hls_segment_filename filename"
Set the segment filename. Unless \f(CW\*(C`hls_flags single_file\*(C'\fR is set,

.SS "image2"
.IX Subsection "image2"
Image file muxer.
.PP
The image file muxer writes video frames to image files.
.PP
The output filenames are specified by a pattern, which can be used to
produce sequentially numbered series of files.
The pattern may contain the string \*(L"%d\*(R" or "%0\fIN\fRd\*(L", this string
specifies the position of the characters representing a numbering in
the filenames. If the form \*(R"%0\fIN\fRd" is used, the string
representing the number in each filename is 0\-padded to \fIN\fR
digits. The literal character '%' can be specified in the pattern with
the string \*(L"%%\*(R".
.PP
If the pattern contains \*(L"%d\*(R" or "%0\fIN\fRd", the first filename of
the file list specified will contain the number 1, all the following
numbers will be sequential.
.PP
The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the image files to write.
.PP
For example the pattern \*(L"img\-%03d.bmp\*(R" will specify a sequence of
filenames of the form \fIimg\-001.bmp\fR, \fIimg\-002.bmp\fR, ...,
\&\fIimg\-010.bmp\fR, etc.
The pattern \*(L"img%%\-%d.jpg\*(R" will specify a sequence of filenames of the
form \fIimg%\-1.jpg\fR, \fIimg%\-2.jpg\fR, ..., \fIimg%\-10.jpg\fR,
etc.
.PP

.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.avi \-vsync cfr \-r 1 \-f image2 \*(Aqimg\-%03d.jpeg\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Note that with \fBffmpeg\fR, if the format is not specified with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR option and the output filename specifies an image file
format, the image2 muxer is automatically selected, so the previous
command can be written as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.avi \-vsync cfr \-r 1 \*(Aqimg\-%03d.jpeg\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Note also that the pattern must not necessarily contain \*(L"%d\*(R" or
"%0\fIN\fRd", for example to create a single image file
\&\fIimg.jpeg\fR from the start of the input video you can employ the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.avi \-f image2 \-frames:v 1 img.jpeg

This muxer supports the following options:
.IP "\fBreserve_index_space\fR" 4
.IX Item "reserve_index_space"
By default, this muxer writes the index for seeking (called cues in Matroska
terms) at the end of the file, because it cannot know in advance how much space
to leave for the index at the beginning of the file. However for some use cases
\&\*(-- e.g.  streaming where seeking is possible but slow \*(-- it is useful to put the
index at the beginning of the file.
.Sp
If this option is set to a non-zero value, the muxer will reserve a given amount
of space in the file header and then try to write the cues there when the muxing
finishes. If the available space does not suffice, muxing will fail. A safe size
for most use cases should be about 50kB per hour of video.

\&\s-1MOV/MP4/ISMV \s0(Smooth Streaming) muxer.
.PP
The mov/mp4/ismv muxer supports fragmentation. Normally, a \s-1MOV/MP4\s0
file has all the metadata about all packets stored in one location
(written at the end of the file, it can be moved to the start for
better playback by adding \fIfaststart\fR to the \fImovflags\fR, or
using the \fBqt-faststart\fR tool). A fragmented
file consists of a number of fragments, where packets and metadata
about these packets are stored together. Writing a fragmented
file has the advantage that the file is decodable even if the
writing is interrupted (while a normal \s-1MOV/MP4\s0 is undecodable if
it is not properly finished), and it requires less memory when writing
very long files (since writing normal \s-1MOV/MP4\s0 files stores info about
every single packet in memory until the file is closed). The downside
is that it is less compatible with other applications.
.PP
\fIOptions\fR

Fragmentation is enabled by setting one of the AVOptions that define
how to cut the file into fragments:
.IP "\fB\-moov_size\fR \fIbytes\fR" 4

one of the specified conditions is fulfilled. The exception to this is
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-min_frag_duration\*(C'\fR, which has to be fulfilled for any of the other
conditions to apply.
.PP
Additionally, the way the output file is written can be adjusted
through a few other options:
.IP "\fB\-movflags empty_moov\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags empty_moov"
Write an initial moov atom directly at the start of the file, without
describing any samples in it. Generally, an mdat/moov pair is written
at the start of the file, as a normal \s-1MOV/MP4\s0 file, containing only
a short portion of the file. With this option set, there is no initial
mdat atom, and the moov atom only describes the tracks but has
a zero duration.
.Sp
This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.
.IP "\fB\-movflags separate_moof\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags separate_moof"
Write a separate moof (movie fragment) atom for each track. Normally,
packets for all tracks are written in a moof atom (which is slightly
more efficient), but with this option set, the muxer writes one moof/mdat
pair for each track, making it easier to separate tracks.
.Sp
This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.
.IP "\fB\-movflags faststart\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags faststart"
Run a second pass moving the index (moov atom) to the beginning of the file.
This operation can take a while, and will not work in various situations such

Add \s-1RTP\s0 hinting tracks to the output file.
.IP "\fB\-movflags disable_chpl\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags disable_chpl"
Disable Nero chapter markers (chpl atom).  Normally, both Nero chapters
and a QuickTime chapter track are written to the file. With this option
set, only the QuickTime chapter track will be written. Nero chapters can
cause failures when the file is reprocessed with certain tagging programs, like
mp3Tag 2.61a and iTunes 11.3, most likely other versions are affected as well.
.IP "\fB\-movflags omit_tfhd_offset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags omit_tfhd_offset"
Do not write any absolute base_data_offset in tfhd atoms. This avoids
tying fragments to absolute byte positions in the file/streams.
.IP "\fB\-movflags default_base_moof\fR" 4
.IX Item "-movflags default_base_moof"
Similarly to the omit_tfhd_offset, this flag avoids writing the
absolute base_data_offset field in tfhd atoms, but does so by using
the new default-base-is-moof flag instead. This flag is new from
14496\-12:2012. This may make the fragments easier to parse in certain
circumstances (avoiding basing track fragment location calculations
on the implicit end of the previous track fragment).
.IP "\fB\-write_tmcd\fR" 4

Specify \f(CW\*(C`on\*(C'\fR to force writing a timecode track, \f(CW\*(C`off\*(C'\fR to disable it

.IX Item "-movflags negative_cts_offsets"
Enables utilization of version 1 of the \s-1CTTS\s0 box, in which the \s-1CTS\s0 offsets can

.IP "\(bu" 4
An ID3v2 metadata header at the beginning (enabled by default). Versions 2.3 and
2.4 are supported, the \f(CW\*(C`id3v2_version\*(C'\fR private option controls which one is
used (3 or 4). Setting \f(CW\*(C`id3v2_version\*(C'\fR to 0 disables the ID3v2 header
completely.
.Sp
The muxer supports writing attached pictures (\s-1APIC\s0 frames) to the ID3v2 header.
The pictures are supplied to the muxer in form of a video stream with a single
packet. There can be any number of those streams, each will correspond to a
single \s-1APIC\s0 frame.  The stream metadata tags \fItitle\fR and \fIcomment\fR map
to \s-1APIC \s0\fIdescription\fR and \fIpicture type\fR respectively. See
<\fBhttp://id3.org/id3v2.4.0\-frames\fR> for allowed picture types.
.Sp
Note that the \s-1APIC\s0 frames must be written at the beginning, so the muxer will
buffer the audio frames until it gets all the pictures. It is therefore advised
to provide the pictures as soon as possible to avoid excessive buffering.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A Xing/LAME frame right after the ID3v2 header (if present). It is enabled by

Ogg container muxer.
.IP "\fB\-page_duration\fR \fIduration\fR" 4
.IX Item "-page_duration duration"
Preferred page duration, in microseconds. The muxer will attempt to create
pages that are approximately \fIduration\fR microseconds long. This allows the
user to compromise between seek granularity and container overhead. The default
is 1 second. A value of 0 will fill all segments, making pages as large as
possible. A value of 1 will effectively use 1 packet-per-page in most
situations, giving a small seek granularity at the cost of additional container
overhead.
.IP "\fB\-serial_offset\fR \fIvalue\fR" 4

This muxer outputs streams to a number of separate files of nearly

the \fBstrftime\fR option is enabled.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`stream_segment\*(C'\fR is a variant of the muxer used to write to
streaming output formats, i.e. which do not require global headers,
and is recommended for outputting e.g. to \s-1MPEG\s0 transport stream segments.
\&\f(CW\*(C`ssegment\*(C'\fR is a shorter alias for \f(CW\*(C`stream_segment\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Every segment starts with a keyframe of the selected reference stream,
which is set through the \fBreference_stream\fR option.
.PP
Note that if you want accurate splitting for a video file, you need to
make the input key frames correspond to the exact splitting times
expected by the segmenter, or the segment muxer will start the new
segment with the key frame found next after the specified start
time.
.PP
The segment muxer works best with a single constant frame rate video.

Optionally it can generate a list of the created segments, by setting
the option \fIsegment_list\fR. The list type is specified by the

.SS "fifo"
.IX Subsection "fifo"
The fifo pseudo-muxer allows the separation of encoding and muxing by using
first-in-first-out queue and running the actual muxer in a separate thread. This
is especially useful in combination with the \fBtee\fR muxer and can be used to
send data to several destinations with different reliability/writing speed/latency.
.PP
\&\s-1API\s0 users should be aware that callback functions (interrupt_callback,
io_open and io_close) used within its AVFormatContext must be thread-safe.
.PP
The behavior of the fifo muxer if the queue fills up or if the output fails is
selectable,
.IP "\(bu" 4
output can be transparently restarted with configurable delay between retries
based on real time or time of the processed stream.
.IP "\(bu" 4
encoding can be blocked during temporary failure, or continue transparently
dropping packets in case fifo queue fills up.

.IX Item "queue_size"
Specify size of the queue (number of packets). Default value is 60.
.IP "\fBformat_opts\fR" 4
.IX Item "format_opts"
Specify format options for the underlying muxer. Muxer options can be specified
as a list of \fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs separated by ':'.
.IP "\fBdrop_pkts_on_overflow\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "drop_pkts_on_overflow bool"
If set to 1 (true), in case the fifo queue fills up, packets will be dropped
rather than blocking the encoder. This makes it possible to continue streaming without
delaying the input, at the cost of omitting part of the stream. By default
this option is set to 0 (false), so in such cases the encoder will be blocked
until the muxer processes some of the packets and none of them is lost.
.IP "\fBattempt_recovery\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "attempt_recovery bool"
If failure occurs, attempt to recover the output. This is especially useful
when used with network output, since it makes it possible to restart streaming transparently.
By default this option is set to 0 (false).
.IP "\fBmax_recovery_attempts\fR" 4
.IX Item "max_recovery_attempts"
Sets maximum number of successive unsuccessful recovery attempts after which
the output fails permanently. By default this option is set to 0 (unlimited).
.IP "\fBrecovery_wait_time\fR \fIduration\fR" 4
.IX Item "recovery_wait_time duration"
Waiting time before the next recovery attempt after previous unsuccessful
recovery attempt. Default value is 5 seconds.
.IP "\fBrecovery_wait_streamtime\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "recovery_wait_streamtime bool"
If set to 0 (false), the real time is used when waiting for the recovery
attempt (i.e. the recovery will be attempted after at least
recovery_wait_time seconds).
If set to 1 (true), the time of the processed stream is taken into account
instead (i.e. the recovery will be attempted after at least \fIrecovery_wait_time\fR
seconds of the stream is omitted).
By default, this option is set to 0 (false).
.IP "\fBrecover_any_error\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "recover_any_error bool"
If set to 1 (true), recovery will be attempted regardless of type of the error

.SS "tee"
.IX Subsection "tee"
The tee muxer can be used to write the same data to several files or any
other kind of muxer. It can be used, for example, to both stream a video to
the network and save it to disk at the same time.
.PP
It is different from specifying several outputs to the \fBffmpeg\fR
command-line tool because the audio and video data will be encoded only once
with the tee muxer; encoding can be a very expensive process. It is not
useful when using the libavformat \s-1API\s0 directly because it is then possible
to feed the same packets to several muxers directly.
.IP "\fBuse_fifo\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "use_fifo bool"
If set to 1, slave outputs will be processed in separate thread using \fBfifo\fR
muxer. This allows to compensate for different speed/latency/reliability of
outputs and setup transparent recovery. By default this feature is turned off.
.IP "\fBfifo_options\fR" 4
.IX Item "fifo_options"
Options to pass to fifo pseudo-muxer instances. See \fBfifo\fR.
.PP
The slave outputs are specified in the file name given to the muxer,
separated by '|'. If any of the slave name contains the '|' separator,
leading or trailing spaces or any special character, it must be
escaped (see \fBthe \*(L"Quoting and escaping\*(R"
section in the \f(BIffmpeg\-utils\fB\|(1) manual\fR).
.PP
Muxer options can be specified for each slave by prepending them as a list of
\&\fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs separated by ':', between square brackets. If
the options values contain a special character or the ':' separator, they
must be escaped; note that this is a second level escaping.
.PP
The following special options are also recognized:
.IP "\fBf\fR" 4
.IX Item "f"
Specify the format name. Useful if it cannot be guessed from the
output name suffix.
.IP "\fBbsfs[/\fR\fIspec\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "bsfs[/spec]"
Specify a list of bitstream filters to apply to the specified
output.
.IP "\fBuse_fifo\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "use_fifo bool"
This allows to override tee muxer use_fifo option for individual slave muxer.
.IP "\fBfifo_options\fR" 4
.IX Item "fifo_options"
This allows to override tee muxer fifo_options for individual slave muxer.
See \fBfifo\fR.
.Sp
It is possible to specify to which streams a given bitstream filter
applies, by appending a stream specifier to the option separated by
\&\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR. \fIspec\fR must be a stream specifier (see \fBFormat
stream specifiers\fR).  If the stream specifier is not specified, the
bitstream filters will be applied to all streams in the output.
.Sp
Several bitstream filters can be specified, separated by \*(L",\*(R".
.IP "\fBselect\fR" 4
.IX Item "select"
Select the streams that should be mapped to the slave output,
specified by a stream specifier. If not specified, this defaults to
all the input streams. You may use multiple stream specifiers
separated by commas (\f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR) e.g.: \f(CW\*(C`a:0,v\*(C'\fR
.IP "\fBonfail\fR" 4
.IX Item "onfail"

.SH "METADATA"
.IX Header "METADATA"
FFmpeg is able to dump metadata from media files into a simple UTF\-8\-encoded
INI-like text file and then load it back using the metadata muxer/demuxer.
.PP
The file format is as follows:
.IP "1." 4
A file consists of a header and a number of metadata tags divided into sections,
each on its own line.
.IP "2." 4
The header is a \fB;FFMETADATA\fR string, followed by a version number (now 1).
.IP "3." 4
Metadata tags are of the form \fBkey=value\fR
.IP "4." 4
Immediately after header follows global metadata
.IP "5." 4
After global metadata there may be sections with per\-stream/per\-chapter
metadata.
.IP "6." 4
A section starts with the section name in uppercase (i.e. \s-1STREAM\s0 or \s-1CHAPTER\s0) in
brackets (\fB[\fR, \fB]\fR) and ends with next section or end of file.
.IP "7." 4
At the beginning of a chapter section there may be an optional timebase to be
used for start/end values. It must be in form
\&\fBTIMEBASE=\fR\fInum\fR\fB/\fR\fIden\fR, where \fInum\fR and \fIden\fR are
integers. If the timebase is missing then start/end times are assumed to
be in milliseconds.
.Sp
Next a chapter section must contain chapter start and end times in form
\&\fBSTART=\fR\fInum\fR, \fBEND=\fR\fInum\fR, where \fInum\fR is a positive
integer.
.IP "8." 4
Empty lines and lines starting with \fB;\fR or \fB#\fR are ignored.
.IP "9." 4
Metadata keys or values containing special characters (\fB=\fR, \fB;\fR,
\&\fB#\fR, \fB\e\fR and a newline) must be escaped with a backslash \fB\e\fR.
.IP "10." 4
Note that whitespace in metadata (e.g. \fBfoo = bar\fR) is considered to be
a part of the tag (in the example above key is \fBfoo\fR , value is
 \fBbar\fR).
.PP
A ffmetadata file might look like this:

the receive or send buffer size, depending on what the socket is used for.
Default is 64KB.  See also \fIfifo_size\fR.
.IP "\fBbitrate=\fR\fIbitrate\fR" 4
.IX Item "bitrate=bitrate"
If set to nonzero, the output will have the specified constant bitrate if the
input has enough packets to sustain it.
.IP "\fBburst_bits=\fR\fIbits\fR" 4

Override the local \s-1UDP\s0 port to bind with.
.IP "\fBlocaladdr=\fR\fIaddr\fR" 4
.IX Item "localaddr=addr"
Choose the local \s-1IP\s0 address. This is useful e.g. if sending multicast
and the host has multiple interfaces, where the user can choose
which interface to send on by specifying the \s-1IP\s0 address of that interface.
.IP "\fBpkt_size=\fR\fIsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "pkt_size=size"
Set the size in bytes of \s-1UDP\s0 packets.

.IP "\fBconnect=\fR\fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "connect=1|0"
Initialize the \s-1UDP\s0 socket with \f(CW\*(C`connect()\*(C'\fR. In this case, the
destination address can't be changed with ff_udp_set_remote_url later.
If the destination address isn't known at the start, this option can
be specified in ff_udp_set_remote_url, too.
This allows finding out the source address for the packets with getsockname,
and makes writes return with \s-1AVERROR\s0(\s-1ECONNREFUSED\s0) if \*(L"destination
unreachable\*(R" is received.
For receiving, this gives the benefit of only receiving packets from
the specified peer address/port.
.IP "\fBsources=\fR\fIaddress\fR\fB[,\fR\fIaddress\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "sources=address[,address]"
Only receive packets sent to the multicast group from one of the

Use linear interpolation when enabled (the default). Disable it if you want
to preserve speed instead of quality when exact_rational fails.
.IP "\fBexact_rational\fR" 4
.IX Item "exact_rational"
For swr only, when enabled, try to use exact phase_count based on input and
output sample rate. However, if it is larger than \f(CW\*(C`1 << phase_shift\*(C'\fR,
the phase_count will be \f(CW\*(C`1 << phase_shift\*(C'\fR as fallback. Default is enabled.

For soxr only, the precision in bits to which the resampled signal will be
calculated.  The default value of 20 (which, with suitable dithering, is
appropriate for a destination bit-depth of 16) gives SoX's 'High Quality'; a
value of 28 gives SoX's 'Very High Quality'.

For swr only, simple 1 parameter audio sync to timestamps using stretching,
squeezing, filling and trimming. Setting this to 1 will enable filling and
trimming, larger values represent the maximum amount in samples that the data
may be stretched or squeezed for each second.
Default value is 0, thus no compensation is applied to make the samples match
the audio timestamps.
.IP "\fBfirst_pts\fR" 4
.IX Item "first_pts"
For swr only, assume the first pts should be this value. The time unit is 1 / sample rate.
This allows for padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no
assumption is made about the first frame's expected pts, so no padding or
trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with
silence if an audio stream starts after the video stream or to trim any samples
with a negative pts due to encoder delay.
.IP "\fBmin_comp\fR" 4
.IX Item "min_comp"
For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in
seconds) to trigger stretching/squeezing/filling or trimming of the
data to make it match the timestamps. The default is that
stretching/squeezing/filling and trimming is disabled
(\fBmin_comp\fR = \f(CW\*(C`FLT_MAX\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\fBmin_hard_comp\fR" 4
.IX Item "min_hard_comp"
For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in
seconds) to trigger adding/dropping samples to make it match the
timestamps.  This option effectively is a threshold to select between
hard (trim/fill) and soft (squeeze/stretch) compensation. Note that
all compensation is by default disabled through \fBmin_comp\fR.
The default is 0.1.
.IP "\fBcomp_duration\fR" 4
